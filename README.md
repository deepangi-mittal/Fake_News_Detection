# Fake News Detection using Word2Vec and Machine Learning
Tools: Python, Word2Vec (Gensim), Scikit-learn, Pandas, Spacy, Matplotlib

- Built a machine learning model to classify news articles as fake or real using semantic word embeddings (Word2Vec) for feature extraction.

- Preprocessed textual data (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization) using Spacy and converted tokens into dense vector representations using Gensimâ€™s Word2Vec.

- Aggregated word vectors to form document-level features and trained classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM) for binary classification.

- Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and visualized confusion matrix for interpretation.

- Demonstrated understanding of NLP, vector embeddings, and model evaluation techniques in a real-world text classification problem.
